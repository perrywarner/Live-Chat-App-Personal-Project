am ex CTH (project: "BodesWell")

12 mo cth
62.50/hr ($62.50/hr * 2088 work hours without holidays/year = $130,500 without holidays / year)
after 12 mo: full time employee at AMEX (almost guaranteed)

context: CTH tends to be faster onboarding process (2 week get started vs longer)

note: against Contract right now
- would need +~$10k to pay for 3 weeks vacation & 1 week sick time
- would need +~$10-20k to pay for IRA & rest of benefits
- kathy says tax situation for independent contractors is very difficult to deal with, more paperwork generally required
